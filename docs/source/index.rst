Overview
--------

*gsplat* is an open-source library for CUDA accelerated rasterization of gaussians with python bindings. It is inspired by the SIGGRAPH paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields" :cite:p:`kerbl3Dgaussians`.
This libary contains the neccessary components for efficient 3D to 2D projection, sorting, and alpha compositing of gaussians and their associated backward passes for inverse rendering.

Contributing
------------

This repository was born from the curiosity of people on the Nerfstudio team trying to understand a new rendering technique. We welcome contributions of any kind and are open to feedback, bug-reports, and improvements to help expand the capabilities of this software.
