gsplat is an open-source library for CUDA accelerated rasterization of gaussians with python bindings. It is inspired by the SIGGRAPH paper [3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/), but we’ve made gsplat even faster, more memory efficient, and with a growing list of new features!

## Installation

**Dependence**: Please install [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) first.

The easiest way is to install from PyPI. In this way it will build the CUDA code **on the first run** (JIT).

```bash
pip install gsplat
```

Alternatively you can install gsplat from source. In this way it will build the CUDA code during installation.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat.git
```

We also provide [pre-compiled wheels](https://docs.gsplat.studio/whl) for both linux and windows on certain python-torch-CUDA combinations (please check first which versions are supported). Note this way you would have to manually install [gsplat's dependencies](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat/blob/6022cf45a19ee307803aaf1f19d407befad2a033/setup.py#L115). For example, to install gsplat for pytorch 2.0 and cuda 11.8 you can run
```
pip install ninja numpy jaxtyping rich
pip install gsplat --index-url https://docs.gsplat.studio/whl/pt20cu118
```

To build gsplat from source on Windows, please check [this instruction](docs/INSTALL_WIN.md).

## Evaluation

This repo comes with a standalone script that reproduces the official Gaussian Splatting with exactly the same performance on PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and converged number of Gaussians. Powered by gsplat’s efficient CUDA implementation, the training takes up to **4x less GPU memory** with up to **15% less time** to finish than the official implementation. Full report can be found [here](https://docs.gsplat.studio/main/tests/eval.html).

```bash
cd examples
pip install -r requirements.txt
# download mipnerf_360 benchmark data
python datasets/download_dataset.py
# run batch evaluation
bash benchmarks/basic.sh
```
