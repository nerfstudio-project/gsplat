gsplat is an open-source library for CUDA accelerated rasterization of gaussians with python bindings. It is inspired by the SIGGRAPH paper [3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/), but we’ve made gsplat even faster, more memory efficient, and with a growing list of new features!

## Installation

**Dependence**: Please install [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) first.

The easist way is to install from PyPI. In this way it will build the CUDA code **on the first run** (JIT).

```bash
pip install gsplat
```

Or install from source. In this way it will build the CUDA code during installation.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat.git
```

## Evaluation

This repo comes with a standalone script that reproduces the official Gaussian Splatting with exactly the same performance on PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and converged number of Gaussians. Powered by gsplat’s efficient CUDA implementation, the training takes up to **4x less GPU memory** with up to **2x less time** to finish than the official implementation. Full report can be found [here](https://docs.gsplat.studio/main/tests/eval.html).

```bash
# under examples/
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash benchmark.sh
```
