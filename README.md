# clangd setup (for Neovim)

[clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/) is a nice tool for providing completions,
type checking, and other helpful features in C++. It requires some extra effort
to get set up for CUDA development, but there are fortunately only three steps
here.

**First,** we should install a `clangd` extension for our IDE/editor.

For Neovim+lspconfig users, this is very easy, we can simply install `clangd`
via Mason and add a few setup lines in Lua:

```lua
require("lspconfig").clangd.setup{
    capabilities = capabilities
}
```

**Second,** we need to generate a `.clangd` configuration file with the current
CUDA path argument.

Make sure you're in the right environment (with CUDA installed), and then from
the root of the repository, you can run:

```sh
echo "# Autogenerated, see .clangd_template\!" > .clangd && sed -e "/^#/d" -e "s|YOUR_CUDA_PATH|$(dirname $(dirname $(which nvcc)))|" .clangd_template >> .clangd
```

**Third,** we'll need a
[`compile_comands.json`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html)
file.

If we're working on PyTorch bindings, one option is to generate this using
[`bear`](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear):

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bear

# From the repository root, 3dgs-exercise/.
#
# This will save a file at 3dgs-exercise/compile_commands.json, which clangd
# should be able to detect.
bear -- pip install -e diff_rast/

# Make sure the file is not empty!
cat compile_commands.json
```

Alternatively: if we're working directly in C (and don't need any PyTorch
binding stuff), we can generate via CMake:

```sh
# From 3dgs-exercise/csrc/build.
#
# This will save a file at 3dgs-exercise/csrc/build/compile_commands.json, which
# clangd should be able to detect.
cmake .. -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=on

# Make sure the file is not empty!
cat compile_commands.json
```

**Known issues**

- The torch extensions include currently raises an error:
  `In included file: use of undeclared identifier 'noinline'; did you mean 'inline'?`
